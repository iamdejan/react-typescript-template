# React TypeScript Template

This is an opionated React TypeScript template.

## Why opionated?

I believe in consistency in syntax. Unfortunately, JavaScript and TypeScript aren't very strict in syntax (e.g. declaring a string with either single or double quotes, optional semi-colon at the end of the statement, etc.).

This repo is created so that I don't have to setup ESLint and TanStack Router anymore.
