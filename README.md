# React TypeScript Template

This is an opionated React TypeScript template.

## Why opionated?

I believe in consistency in syntax. Unfortunately, JavaScript and TypeScript aren't very strict in syntax (e.g. declaring a string with either single or double quotes, optional semi-colon at the end of the statement, etc.).

This repo is created so that I don't have to setup ESLint and TanStack Router anymore.

## Prerequisites

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Install at 2 stages:

-   `commit-msg`: `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`
-   `pre-push`: `pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push`
